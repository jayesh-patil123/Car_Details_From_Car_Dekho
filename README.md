Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Car Details from CarDekho

Project Objective: Extract valuable insights and trends about used cars listed on the CarDekho platform through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Dataset Overview: The dataset includes key features like car name, year of manufacture, selling price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, and ownership status.

Data Cleaning & Preparation: Preprocessed data by handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring data integrity. Applied data imputation and outlier detection to maintain data quality.

Univariate Analysis: Analyzed distributions of car prices, fuel types, transmission types, and ownership status using histograms, bar charts, and box plots to identify patterns and anomalies.

Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis: Explored relationships between key features, such as the impact of kilometers driven, car age, and fuel type on selling price. Utilized scatter plots, heatmaps, and pair plots to reveal correlations and dependencies.

Insights & Patterns: Identified significant trends like car brands with higher resale value, the impact of ownership type (first, second, or third) on price, and how transmission (manual or automatic) affects selling price.

Data Visualization: Used Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create clear, interactive insights. Visuals like heatmaps, scatter plots, and distribution plots highlighted data patterns and relationships.

Feature Engineering: Created new features, like categorizing cars by age groups and normalizing continuous variables, to enhance the depth of the analysis.

Statistical Analysis: Applied hypothesis testing, t-tests, and ANOVA to validate insights and support data-driven conclusions regarding the impact of fuel type and seller type on pricing.

Business Impact: Delivered actionable insights for car buyers and sellers. Highlighted car models with higher resale value and key price-influencing factors, enabling buyers to make informed decisions and sellers to set competitive prices.
